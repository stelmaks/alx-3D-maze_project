## Introduction
This project aims to create a 3D maze game using raycasting techniques. Raycasting involves 
simulating the projection of a 3D environment onto a 2D screen, creating the illusion of a 3D space.
 Players will explore the maze from a first-person perspective and try to reach the exit by following the correct path.

## Features
- Real-time rendering of a 3D maze using raycasting.
- First-person perspective for an immersive gaming experience.
- Maze generation algorithms to create randomized mazes for each playthrough.
- Visual indicators for the start and exit points of the maze.
- Simple controls for navigation.
